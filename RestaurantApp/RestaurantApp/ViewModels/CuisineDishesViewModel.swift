        // The API `get_item_by_id` fetches a single item by ID, not a list for a cuisine.
        // The requirement "This screen will have a list of dishes particular to that cuisine category. Fetch the particular dish by API: get_item_by_id" is a bit contradictory.
        // Assuming `get_item_list` on the home screen already gave us items for that cuisine.
        // If not, we'd need a new API or iterate `get_item_by_id` for all dish IDs in a cuisine, which is inefficient.
        // For now, let's assume this screen gets its initial list of dishes from the selected Cuisine object passed from Home.
        // However, if we *must* use `get_item_by_id` here to populate a list, it implies we have a list of `item_id`s.
        // The API doc for `get_item_by_id` returns a single item.

        // *Correction based on API Doc & Common Sense:*
        // The most logical way to get a list of dishes for a cuisine when `get_item_by_id` only returns one,
        // is that the `Cuisine` object passed from `HomeViewModel` (via `get_item_list`) already contains the `items` array.
        // If `get_item_by_id` was strictly meant, then `get_item_list` would just return cuisine_id/name and we'd then query for each item ID found.
        // Given the requirement, I will fetch a *sample* dish using `get_item_by_id` just to demonstrate its use,
        // but typically a list of dishes for a cuisine is obtained differently.

        // To fulfill "Fetch the particular dish by API: get_item_by_id" for a *list*:
        // This would require us to have the item IDs for a cuisine first.
        // Since `get_item_list` returns `cuisines.items`, we *could* pass the entire `Cuisine` object.

        // Let's adapt: For this screen, we will assume the `HomeViewModel` passed the `Cuisine` object containing `items`.
        // If we really *must* use `get_item_by_id` for *all* dishes of a cuisine, it's a very inefficient API design.
        // I will simulate by fetching a single item to satisfy the requirement if a dish ID is known,
        // but for a *list*, the data should come from the initial `Cuisine` object.

        // If you were to pass a specific `Dish` from the `HomeViewController` to initialize this ViewModel:
        // Then `get_item_by_id` makes sense to fetch *that specific dish's updated details*.
        // But the requirement says "list of dishes particular to that cuisine category."

        // *Revised Strategy for `CuisineDishesViewModel`:*
        // The primary data source for `dishes` should be the `items` array from the `Cuisine` object
        // passed from the `HomeViewModel`. We will only use `get_item_by_id` if we need to refresh
        // details for a specific item, or if the initial `Cuisine` object *didn't* contain `items`
        // and we had to retrieve them one by one (which is bad practice for a list).

        // For simplicity and to meet the spirit of "list of dishes particular to that cuisine category",
        // I'll assume the `Cuisine` object already has its `items` populated from `get_item_list`.
        // If the `Cuisine` is initialized with `nil` or empty `items`, and the *only* way to get them
        // is `get_item_by_id`, then a specific `item_id` for *every* dish would need to be known.
        // This is a common API misunderstanding in requirements.

        // Let's assume the `Cuisine` object (which is passed to this VM) has the list of items.
        // We'll simulate fetching a single item using `get_item_by_id` to demonstrate the API usage.

        // To make this ViewModel more robust and correctly use `get_item_by_id`,
        // it would need a list of `item_id`s to fetch. This usually comes from another API,
        // or the initial `get_item_list` would only give `cuisine_id` and `item_id`s, not full dish details.

        // Given the ambiguity, I'll pass the `items` directly if available from the `Cuisine`
        // and add a placeholder/demonstration for `get_item_by_id`.
    }

    // This initializer should ideally receive the dishes directly if they are already fetched
    // with the cuisine from `get_item_list`.
